=>  What is Big O Notation

    Language computer scientists use when compating the performance of algorithms.
    
    it's all about dominant operations.
    - time (how fast)
    - space (how much memory)


1. Big O is the language used to compare performance of algorithms (time and space).

    Most common characteristics are: 

    Constant O(1)
    Linear O(n)
    Quadratic O(n^2)
    Logarithmic O(logn)

2. When measuring O(n), always think wost case.

3. Can often trade-off time for space.
